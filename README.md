#YouTube stands as one of the globe's most extensive video-sharing platforms, featuring more than 800 million uploads. Yet, only a tiny percentage achieve viral status or appear in trending lists. This project explores the characteristics that set widely popular videos apart from typical uploads by examining three core metrics:

View count: Total viewers of the video.

Like/Dislike ratio: User engagement indicating approval or disapproval.

Category ID: The video’s classification within YouTube’s content system.

Collaborating with my team, we analyzed U.S.-based YouTube video data using Python, pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools like Matplotlib. Our approach focused on statistical evaluation and intuitive visual summaries to highlight overarching trends—such as correlations between engagement metrics and virality—without requiring granular data scrutiny. This streamlined presentation enables audiences to quickly grasp factors influencing a video’s success, from audience interaction patterns to category-specific trends.
