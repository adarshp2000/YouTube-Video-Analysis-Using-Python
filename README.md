# Youtube-Video-Analysis-Project
YouTube is one of the world's largest streaming platforms, hosting over 800 million videos. However, only a small fraction of these videos gain widespread attention and become "viral" or "trending." This project aims to analyze the vast collection of YouTube videos and identify patterns that differentiate viral videos from regular ones.

To assess the quality of a video, we use three key numerical parameters:

  #views: The number of users who have watched the video.
  
  #likes: The number of users who appreciated the video.
  
  #dislikes: The number of users who did not enjoy the video.
  
  #category_id: The classification ID of the video.


For this project, my team and I worked with a dataset of YouTube videos from the United States, utilizing Python, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and other libraries to conduct statistical analysis and data visualization. The goal was to present key takeaways without requiring an in-depth examination of each data point, allowing audiences to grasp essential trends and patterns emerging from the dataset.
